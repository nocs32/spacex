Its just a knowlege test project.
Developed by Tim N.

Task Description

Launches must be shown in a Pinterest-like grid (with any image of launch or youtube preview as a thumbnail) where the recent launches are always above the older ones. The grid must use the infinite scroll approach to load older launches. Launches can be filtered by any 2 criteria (you can choose) and 1 required filter is by rocket name. Total - 3 filters. Click on launch thumbnail must open a popup with launch details.
